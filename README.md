# NFT Smart Contracts for Circular Economy of WEEE

The purpose of this application is to mint and transfer NFTs which link to recyclable components of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE). Each NFT contains a componentâ€™s metadata. By tracking the NFTs (and their metadata) transferred between the wallets owned by different entities, such as manufacturers, repairers, and recycle service agents, the system can collect circular economic information and calculate carbon credits based on the reuse and recovery of the Waste of EEE. This is a part of the ongoing project that Snowbridge cooperates with AUO Group to develop.

This repository handles the NFT smart contracts, which are only a part of the entire backend system.

## Testing Instructions

### Environment Requirements

- Docker version 27.0.3
- Docker-compose version 1.27.4

### Setup

1. **Configure `docker-compose.yml`**:
   Set the volumes of each container to appropriate locations on your local machine where data can be stored.
2. **Run the Application**:
   Ensure that the `build` folder contains the `auo_eco_token.xml` file. Then, run the following command in the repository directory:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Shut Down**:
   To shut down the application, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
4. **View Logs**:
   To view logs, use the following script:
   `bash
    ./tailLog.sh <container name>
    `
   **Containers**

- lease-node0-db, lease-node1-db, lease-node2-db, lease-node3-db: Postchain databases
- node0-cli, node1-cli, node2-cli, node3-cli: Postchain nodes

**Running the Backend**
To run the backend, follow these steps in the client directory.

**Environment Requirements**

- Node.js version 21 or above
- Yarn version 1.22.19 or above

**Installation**

1. Navigate to the client directory:
